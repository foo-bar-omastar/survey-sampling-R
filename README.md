# Survey Sampling using R

In this project, we are going to understand various aspects of survey sampling in R. We are using R as it allows for easy random sampling and quick calculation.

The problem statement is taken from Chapter 7 (Survey Sampling) Question no. 67 of "Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis" by John A. Rice (University of California, Berkeley). The question conatins a lot of repetitive parts, but we are going to look at only some parts of the questions, hoping to cover maximum topics in survey sampling through this question. 

### Data Description 
The data set families contains information about 43,886 families living in the city of Cyberville. The city has four regions: the Northern region has 10,149 families, the Eastern region has 10,390 families, the Southern region has 13,457 families, and theWestern region has 9,890.

  35: 9th grade
  36: 10th grade
  37: 11th grade
  38: 12th grade, no diploma
  39: High school graduate, high school diploma, or equivalent
  40: Some college but no degree
  41: Associate degree in college (occupation/vocation program)
  42: Associate degree in college (academic program)

  45: Professional school degree (e.g., M.D., D.D.S., D.V.M., LL.B., J.D.)
  46: Doctoral degree (e.g., Ph.D., Ed.D.)

We will learn about the families of Cyberville by using sampling.
